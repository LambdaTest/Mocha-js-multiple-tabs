## How to handle multiple tabs in automation test in Mocha-js on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Mocha-js-multiple-tabs)

If you want to handle multiple tabs using an automation test in Mocha-js on LambdaTest, you can use the follwing steps. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Mocha-selenium-sample).

### Code

Any time you switch between tabs, you’ll want to use the `driver.switchTo().window(<some window>);` method. This allows you to change control from one tab to another. For example:

```js
String newWindow = driver.getWindowHandle();

driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(“body”)).sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL+”t”);
driver.get("URL");
```

To switch back to main window:

```js
driver.switchTo().window(mainWindow);
```

## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```
